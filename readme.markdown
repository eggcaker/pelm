# What's PELM? 

PELM is an Emacs Lisp Manager! What's mean P? the P mean Private or Public (if you like it)
I hope every body like it, but maybe not , if you use Emacs to do PHP language, android, or Obj-C you can download it and have a try. any fork is wellcome!

**Usage:** After you download the source code, just move the directory to ~/.emacs.d, then run command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cd ~/.emacs.d
$ ./script/package.sh init OS
</pre>

which OS is one of linux, mac, win(not test yet), that's all you need to do to use PELM!

**IMPORT NOES**: the PELM using init.el to load everything, delete or move your .emacs file somewhere  before try PELM.
