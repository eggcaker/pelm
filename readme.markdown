What's PELM? 
==============
PELM is an Emacs Lisp Manager! What's mean P? the P can be one of Php or Private or Personal,
because my main programming language is php now and the package created by php. At begin I named the package to ELM, 
but has conflict with [tarsius's elm](http://http://github.com/tarsius/elm). He asked me to change the name,
so, I changed to PELM, if you use Emacs to do PHP language, you can download it and have a try. any fork is wellcome!

**Usage:** After you download the source code, just move the directory to ~/.emacs.d, then run command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cd ~/.emacs.d
$ ./script/package.sh init OS
</pre>

which OS is one of linux, mac, win, that's all you need to do to use PELM!

**IMPORT NOES**: the PELM using init.el to load everything, delete or move your .emacs file somewhere  before try PELM.
