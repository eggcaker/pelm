# What's ELM? 

ELM is Emacs Lisp Manager! Our goal is to make it simple to manage Emacs's lisp. We supply package.sh(and .php),
a simple package manager for Emacs. After you download the source code, just move the directory to ~/.emacs.d, then run command:
    
    cd ~/.emacs.d
    ./script/package.sh init OS

which OS is one of linux, mac, win, that's all you need to do to use ELM!

*IMPORT NOES*: the ELM using init.el to load everything, delete or move your .emacs file before try ELM.
